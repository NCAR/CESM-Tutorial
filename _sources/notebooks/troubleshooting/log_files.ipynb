    "First, check the latest ``cpl.log.*``, which will often tell you when the model failed. If a run completed successfully, the last several lines of the ``cpl.log.*`` file will have a string like ``SUCCESSFUL TERMINATION OF CESM``. \n",

    "\n",
    "If it is not clear that any of the above caused a case to fail, check the rest of the component log files ``$model.log.*`` for error messages. It takes a bit of practice to interpret message errors. We will look at an example in this chapter exercices. "
