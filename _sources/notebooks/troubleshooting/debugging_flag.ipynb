    "# Adding debugging info\n",
    "\n",
    "If you cannot find the reason of the crash in the **log** files, there are two ways to add more debugging information. \n",
    "- Increase the value of the run-time xml variable ``INFO_DBUG`` (This **does NOT require rebuilding**): \n",
    "```\n",
    "./xmlchange INFO_DBUG=2. \n",
    "```\n",
    "This adds more information to the ``cpl.log`` file that can be useful if you canâ€™t tell what component is aborting the run, or where bad coupling fields are originating.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Try rebuilding and rerunning with the variable DEBUG set to TRUE (This ** requires rebuilding**): \n",
    "```\n",
    "./xmlchange DEBUG=TRUE.\n",
    "```\n",
    "This adds various runtime checks that trap conditions such as out-of-bounds array indexing, divide by 0, and other floating point exceptions.\n",
    "Before running, you must rebuild run \n",
    "```\n",
    "./case.build --clean-all\n",
    "qcmd -- ./case.build.\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that the model will run **significantly slower** in ``DEBUG mode``, so this may not be feasible if the model has to run a long time before producing the error. "
