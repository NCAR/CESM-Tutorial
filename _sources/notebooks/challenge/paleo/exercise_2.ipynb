    "<strong>Exercise 2.2: Visualize differences between preindustrial and mid-Holocene monthly output</strong><br><br>\n",
    " \n",
    "There are two ways of defining months or seasons: \n",
    "\n",
    "(1) a “fixed-length” method in which months are defined by a fixed number of days (e.g., January in CESM history files is the first 31 days of a 365-day year) \n",
    "\n",
    "(2) a “fixed-angular” method in which months are defined by a fixed number of degrees of the Earth’s orbit (e.g., January is 31.0 days × (360° / 365-day year = 30.6° of orbit)) \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to changes in Earth’s orbital eccentricity and precession, the portion of Earth’s orbit covered by each fixed-length month varies over time. According to Kepler’s second law (1609), Earth moves faster along its elliptical orbit near perihelion and more slowly near aphelion. Because the calendar days of perihelion and aphelion shift over time, the number of days it takes Earth to traverse a fixed orbital arc (e.g., 30.6°) also changes. This leads to misalignment between fixed-length months relative to solstices/equinoxes when comparing simulations with different orbital configurations. The impact of this misalignment is known as the paleo calendar effect. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, the issue is that CESM history output defines months using the fixed-length method. When comparing simulations of the mid-Holocene with the preindustrial control, a given month (e.g., January) corresponds to different positions in Earth’s orbit. Thus, apparent climate differences reflect both: \n",
    "- changes in insolation from orbital forcing (paleoclimate forcing), and \n",
    "- mismatches in calendar definition (paleo calendar effect) \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** If you have daily-average output from CESM, the calendar effect must still be considered when summarizing those data by months. In this case, you would average daily data using the appropriate (paleo) month starting and ending days, thereby explicitly incorporating the changing month lengths. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, post-processing tools exist to adjust CESM output and account for the paleo calendar effect. Your tasks are: \n",
    "- Convert monthly surface temperature and solar insolation fields from the mid-Holocene CAM history files to a calendar-adjusted monthly format by aggregating pseudo-daily data on fixed-angular calendar appropriate for 6 ka. \n",
    "- Use NCO and Ncview to compare and visualize differences between the mid-Holocene and preindustrial simulations after calendar adjustment. \n",
