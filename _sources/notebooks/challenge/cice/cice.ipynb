    "The sea ice component of CESM is CICE. This is developed by the [CICE Consortium](https://github.com/CICE-Consortium/CICE). Note that CESM2 uses CICE version 5. In version 6 of CICE, the vertical thermodynamics was separated into a submodule known as Icepack. CICE6 will be the sea ice component in CESM3. \n",
