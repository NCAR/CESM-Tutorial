    "**Note 3:** Articles have been published (e.g. [Goelzer et al. (2020)](https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/14/833/2020/)) arguing that the computation of sea level change from stand alone ice sheet model output needs to correct for other factors (e.g. bedrock elevation changes, density correction due to the small difference between ice and fresh water density). In this exercise, we will only be accounting for the changes in total ice volume above floatation. The other correcting factors account for about 10% of the total sea level change magnitude (in general). "

For this reason, it is surprising to see it contribute negatively in this set of experiments especially under a strong warming scenario and these results are highly suspicious. \n",

Looking at the CISM thickness difference plot between the end and beginning of the simulation, the ice thickness evolution correlates closely with the changes in SMB. It is difficult (without further analyzes) to draw any conclusions about the forcing. One can always suspect whether we set the experiment properly. Also, this experiment has not yet been analyzed and one can suspect that the 2 deg version of the CESM model could lead to unexpected climate simulations. \n",

    "In this exercise, we have not talked about how the GrIS was initialized and then used in CESM. Initialization is one of the greatest uncertainties in ice sheet modeling. Here, the model was spun-up using the SMB and air temperature of the RACMO2.3 regional climate model. This way we could invert for the basal physics using observed ice thickness and bed topography. However, there are some biases between RACMO results and the CESM simulated SMB and air temperature which will impact the ice sheet evolution. Ideally, a simulation would correct for these biases which is not the case here.     \n",
