You can find information, track conversations, create issues, and learn lots about what's going on with CESM development through the CESM GitHub repository and the associated wiki.\n",

    "**Note: In the tutorial, where git commands are needed we explicitly detail what commands to use. You will not need to use Github for other activities in this Tutorial. We do however suggest that in your own time you become familar with Github, register as a Github user, and then become an active member of the CESM user and development community. When you make a free account in GitHub to access numerous repositories for different software code development at NCAR and beyond. Github, ESCOMP, and the CESM project are vast and you can get lost in this material for hours, days, weeks or even years. Don't go too far off the path in this tutorial as we are expecting that you will focus on learning other Cheyenne and CESM code download tasks.**"

GitHub is used for storing, tracking, and collaborating on software projects. It makes it easy for developers to share code files and collaborate with fellow developers on open-source projects. GitHub also serves as a social networking site where developers can openly network, collaborate, and pitch their work. GitHub allows software developers to create remote, publically available repositories on the cloud for free. A repository, or \"repo\" for short, is a coding projectâ€™s files and the revision history for each file. "
