    "\n",
    "- Users who have little to no programming experience should take both units in full.\n",
    "- Users that do have some programming experience, such as a web-based language like HTML, but have limited experience in scientific programming, such as a C-based languages, should start with unit 1 and may find they can complete it quickly. While unit 2, covering Fortran and CESM Fortran examples, should be taken in full.\n",
    "- Users that have significant scientific programming experience (C-based languages, for example) can safely start in unit 2, which covers Fortran and CESM Fortran examples.\n",
    "- Users that have significant programming experience in Fortran can likely begin at the \"Fortran and CESM\" subsection (near bottom of table of contents) in unit 2."
