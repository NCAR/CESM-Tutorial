    "## 1. The three run types\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - STARTUP\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a startup run (the default), all model components are initialized from the basic **default initial conditions**. The coupler does not need an initial file. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - BRANCH\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a branch run, all components are initialized using **a consistent set of restart files from a previous run** (determined by the [`$RUN_REFCASE`](./run_variables.ipynb) and [`$RUN_REFDATE`](./run_variables.ipynb) variables in <font face=\"Courier\"><strong>env_run.xml</strong></font>). \n",
    "- The case name is generally changed for a branch run, although it does not have to be. \n",
    "- In a branch run, setting [`$RUN_STARTDATE`](./run_variables.ipynb) is ignored because the model components obtain the start date from their restart datasets. Therefore, **the start date cannot be changed for a branch run**. This is the same mechanism that is used for performing a restart run (where `$CONTINUE_RUN` is set to TRUE in the <font face=\"Courier\"><strong>env_run.xml</strong></font> file).\n",
    "- Branch runs are typically used when sensitivity or parameter studies are required, or when settings for history file output streams need to be modified while still maintaining **bit-for-bit reproducibility**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - HYBRID\n",
    "\n",
    "- A hybrid run indicates that CESM is initialized more like a startup, but uses initialization datasets from a previous case. This is somewhat analogous to a branch run with relaxed restart constraints. \n",
    "- A hybrid run allows users to bring together combinations of initial/restart files from a previous case (specified by [`$RUN_REFCASE`](./run_variables.ipynb)) at a given model output date (specified by [`$RUN_REFDATE`](./run_variables.ipynb)). Unlike a branch run, the starting date of a hybrid run (specified by [`$RUN_STARTDATE`](./run_variables.ipynb)) can be modified relative to the reference case. \n",
    "- In a hybrid run, the model does not continue in a bit-for-bit fashion with respect to the reference case. The resulting climate, however, should be continuous provided that no model source code or namelists are changed in the hybrid run. \n",
    "- The atmosphere is initialized from initial condition files generated by a user-specified CESM simulation. The land, runoff, ocean and ice are initialized from restart files generated by a user-specified CESM simulation. No coupler file is needed\n",
