# Welcome to the [CESM Tutorial](https://ncar.github.io/CESM-Tutorial/README.html)

<br><br>

This repository includes materials for the Community Earth System Model (CESM) tutorial. 

Please see the [CESM webpage](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/events/tutorials) for the most up to date information about when the tutorial will be offered in Boulder, Colorado.

## Goals of This Tutorial
This tutorial is designed as an introduction to running the CESM model. **By the end of this online tutorial you should learn how to run and modify the model and use the output.** 

This tutorial includes the following topics:
* The basics of running CESM
* Simple modifications of xml files, source code, and namelists
* Some challenge exercises
* Troubleshooting
* Basic diagnostics
* Useful tools

The materials and notebooks in this tutorial are published as a Jupyter book here to allow for searchable online documentation, but to run the actual commands you will need a termina window. 

## Getting Further CESM Technical Help
As you gain experience using and running CESM, the [DiscussCESM Forums](https://bb.cgd.ucar.edu/cesm/) are a place where the CESM community can request assistance with science and runtime issues.

## Getting Involved in the CESM Community

NCAR created the Community Climate Model (CCM) in 1983 that included a global atmosphere. In 1994, NCAR scientists started to develop the Climate System Model (CSM) that included models of the atmosphere, land surface, ocean, and sea ice. In order to recognize the community of users and sponsors, the CSM was renamed to the Community Climate System Model (CCSM). With addititons including an ice sheet and biogeochemical modeling, the model was renamed to the Community Earth System Model (CESM) in 2013. 

The CESM project has a strong commitment to Community involvment in governance and development of the CESM. We welcome and strongly encourage anyone interested to join the [CESM working groups](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/working-groups) to participate more fully in the CESM project and model development. 

There is also a long history of open, community workshops. The first community workshop was held in 1996 and continues annually today. We hope to see you at a future [CESM workshop](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/events/workshops)!
