    "- **For the atmosphere component (CAM)**, the physics time step is set by `ATM_NCPL` and `NCPL_BASE_PERIOD`in `env_run.xml`. `NCPL_BASE_PERIOD` specifies base period associated with coupling frequency, the default value is \"day\". The `ATM_NCPL` variable specifies the number of coupling intervals per `NCPL_BASE_PERIOD` between the atmosphere/land and the coupled system. Based on these two variables, the scripts will automatically compute the time step for the atmosphere and land and populate the namelist files accordingly. For example, if `NCPL_BASE_PERIOD` is set to \"day\", and `ATM_NCPL` is 48, then the timestep is 1800 seconds. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **For the land component (CLM)**, the physics time step is the same as the CAM time step; this is automatically set with the CAM time step via `ATM_NCPL`. You cannot set this separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **For the ocean component (POP2)**, the physics time step is changed in the `user_nl_pop` file and is based on `$OCN_NCPL` (found in `env_run.xml`), `dt_count` , and `dt_option`. The default `dt_option` is `“steps_per_day”`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **For the sea ice component (CICE)**, the physics time step is set by the coupling interval variable `$ICE_NCPL` found in env_run.xml. "
