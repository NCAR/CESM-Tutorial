    "## CAMchem and WACCM component sets\n",
    "\n",
    "The CESM2 components can be combined in numerous ways to carry out various scientific or software experiments. A particular mix of components, along with component-specific configuration and/or namelist settings, is called a component set or ``compset``. \n",
    "\n",
    "WACCM and CAMchem are atmospheric components of CESM, like CAM. They can be run as ``F`` and ``B`` compsets, as well as with nudged meteorology. They can run using various dycores and resolutions.\n"
    "In contrast to CAM, WACCM and CAMchem run with different complexity of chemistry, whereby CAM uses simplified chemistry. CAM and CAMchem use the same vertical resolution and model top.\n" 
    "Different chemical mechanisms for CAMchem with more or less complexity have been developed based on the MOZART-TS1 and TS2 (currently most comprehensive) chemical mechanism.\n"
    "WACCM has a top at about 150km and therefore covers the Troposphere, Stratosphere, Mesosphere and Lower-Thermosphere. The most comprehensive WACCM mechanism is therefore called TSMLT chemical mechanism.\n"
    "WACCM can also run with Middle Atmosphere (MA) chemistry (e.g., FWmaHIST, which includes very simplified chemistry in the troposphere, and with Specified Chemistry (e.g., FWscHIST), similar to the CAM chemistry.\n"

   "In CESM2.2 only CAMchem F compsets have been tested and no PI-control or transient history simulation has been validated. In contrast, WACCM has been used for CMIP6 simulations.\n",
   "Two different nudging approaches exist using CAMchem and WACCM, both using MERRA2 or GEOS5 meteorological analysis fields. The ``nudged`` approach is the recommended approach that uses meteorological fields (U, V, T) on CESM model levels.\n",
