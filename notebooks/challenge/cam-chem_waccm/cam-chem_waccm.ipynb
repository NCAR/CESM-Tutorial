    "The CESM2 components can be combined in numerous ways to carry out various scientific or software experiments. A particular mix of components, along with component-specific configuration and/or namelist settings, is called a component set or ``compset``. \n",
    "\n",
    "**WACCM** (Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model) and **CAM-chem** (Community Atmosphere Model with chemistry) are atmospheric components of CESM, like CAM. They can be run as ``F`` and ``B`` compsets, as well as with nudged meteorology (for example towards reanalysis). They can be run using various dycores and resolutions.\n",
    "In contrast to CAM, WACCM and CAM-chem run with different possibilities of chemistry complexity, whereby CAM uses simplified chemistry. CAM and CAM-chem use the same vertical resolution and model top.\n",
    "Different chemical mechanisms for CAM-chem with more or less complexity have been developed based on the MOZART-TS1 and TS2 (currently the most comprehensive) chemical mechanism.\n",
    "WACCM has a model top at about 150km and therefore covers the Troposphere, Stratosphere, Mesosphere and Lower-Thermosphere. The most comprehensive WACCM mechanism is therefore called the TSMLT chemical mechanism.\n",
    "WACCM can also run with Middle Atmosphere (MA) chemistry (e.g., FWmaHIST, which includes very simplified chemistry in the troposphere, and with Specified Chemistry (e.g., FWscHIST), similar to the CAM chemistry.\n"

    "In CESM2.2 only the CAM-chem F compsets have been scientifically tested and no PI-control or transient history simulation has been scientifically validated. In contrast, WACCM has been used for CMIP6 simulations.\n",
