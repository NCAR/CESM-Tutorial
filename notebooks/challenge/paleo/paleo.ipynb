    "Paleoclimatology is the study of ancient climate variability and change, before the availability of instrumental records. \n",
    "\n",
    "Paleoclimatology relies on a combination of physical, biological, and chemical proxies of past environmental and climate change, such as glacial ice, tree rings, sediments, corals, and cave mineral deposits. \n",
    "\n",
    "CESM is widely used for paleoclimate studies. \n",
    "\n",
    "CESM simulations of past climates are a tool to better understand and interpret proxy reconstructions and to evaluate CESM skill in simulating out-of-sample climate states. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many proxy reconstructions are made using measurements of isotopic ratios in natural archives. \n",
    "\n",
    "A version of CESM with the capability to simulate hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios in the water cycle (isotope-enabled CESM) is commonly used in paleoclimate studies to provide more direct signals of comparison with proxies. \n"
