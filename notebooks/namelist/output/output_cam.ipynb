    "- how to output **extra variables**\n",
    "- how to output **extra history files**\n",
    "- how to control the **number of time samples** written to a history file\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be achieved with 3 namelist variables:\n",
    "- **``nhtfrq``**: sets the output frequency\n",
    "- **``fincl``**: add variables to the history file\n",
    "- **``mfilt``**: maximum number of time samples written to a history file\n",

    "## Customizing CAM output frequency: nhtfrq\n",
    "The default history file from CAM is a monthly average. \n",
    "We can change the output frequency with the namelist variable nhtfrq\n",
    "- If **``nhtfrq=0``**, the file will be a **monthly** average\n",
    "- If **``nhtfrq>0``**, frequency is input as number of **timesteps**.\n",
    "- If **``nhtfrq<0``**, frequency is input as number of **hours**.\n",

    "For instance to change the history file from monthly average to daily average, we set the namelist variable:\n",

    "The **steps** to modify the **namelists** are:\n",
    "\n",
    "In ``$CASEROOT`` \n",
    "- edit the **``user_nl_xxx``** files.\n",
    "- generate the namelists by running **``./preview_namelists``**. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "This results in the creation of component namelists, the ``*_in`` files (i.e. atm_in, lnd_in, and so on) in ``$CASEROOT/CaseDocs/`` and in ``$RUNDIR``.\n",
