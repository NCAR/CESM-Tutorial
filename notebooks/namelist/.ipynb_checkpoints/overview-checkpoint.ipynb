    "# Overview of Namelist Modifications \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of ways that the model can be modified via namelist settings. These values control the way the code is run and **do not require a recompile** of the code after they are changed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **namelist variables** include settings to tune the model for various quantities, control over output and many other options. For instance, the output frequency in the different components can be controled via the namelists. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **steps** to modify the **namelists** are:\n",
    "- In ``$CASEROOT`` edit the **``user_nl_xxx``** files.\n",
    "- From ``$CASEROOT`` generate the namelists by running **``./preview_namelists``**. Note that this step is *optional* as the script *preview_namelists* is also called when you build the model. \n",
    "- This results in the creation of component namelists, the ``*_in`` files (``atm_in``, ``lnd_in``, and so on) in ``$CASEROOT/CaseDocs/`` and in ``$RUNDIR``.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``*_in`` files **should not be edited**. Any manual changes of the ``*_in`` files will be overwritten when you compile or submit the run. \n"
